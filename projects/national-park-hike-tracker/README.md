Project requirements
====================

This project needs to be a full-stack web application. As such, it needs to 

satisfy the following set of requirements:

Uses AngularJS on the front-end

Is a single-page application (SPA)

Is responsive

Is well organized, using services and directives where applicable/useful. 

If you're creating a fairly expansive website, consider using separate angular modules as well.

Uses Node.js/Express as the back-end server

Shows a good understanding of module patterns by separating routes, 

models, etc. into their own folders and files

Uses express routers

Uses MongoDB for the database and Mongoose for schema creation and the ODM (Object-Document Mapper)

Since we haven't spent much time learning it yet, your site does not

need to include user authentication of any kind. However, 

you should certainly consider adding it to your application after we learn it!

You also won't necessarily be required to integrate with a third-party API, 

but you should know that it is one of the best ways to make a really 

interesting and useful application in such a short amount of time.
