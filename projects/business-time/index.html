                    <p>The OnePlus X is an interesting device from OnePlus. 
                    It combines the componets used from the companies first flagship 
                    but gives it an overall premium design. Plus the price tag 
                    is only $250 off contract. Now that's saying something.
                    If this doesn't seem like a good idea then, I don't know what will. 
                    Again OnePlus dominating in the budget smartphone market. They always
                    manage to come on top.</p>
