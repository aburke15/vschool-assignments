                    <p>I'd like to think of myself as a tech enthusiast. I feel like 
                    I feel that I know enough about most of it anyway. This is just a 
                    site that I have to document my thoughts on a few smartphones 
                    other than that it's nothing too fancy. It's a pretty basic page 
                    if you ask me. I remember getting my first Android smartphone back 
                    in 2011 it was called the Samsung Infuse 4G. That's when my interest
                    in tech really took off. I also remember watching several YouTube 
                    reviews on that old Samsung phone and I'd get really pumped about 
                    hearing what specs the phone had and what not. I've found that if 
                    you're really into tech then specs do matter. With that said I 
                    would have to say based off of my own speculation that most tech 
                    enthusiast (when talking about smartphones) lean towards Android. 
                    The Android ecosystem is very diverse, so diverse that they 
                    typically require powerful hardware to keep them speedy and efficient. 
                    That is what makes Android such a cool platform, because for tech geeks
                     it's pure power. That's a lot of what keeps me interested in tech. I 
                     like to read about those powerful specs. They always say "specs aren't 
                     everything," well I whole-heartedly disagree.</p>
