Exercise requirements
=====================

Create a simple Angular website.

It should have 3 ng-model input elements and 3 two-way databound 

elements using the {{ nameOfVariable }} syntax.

When you start typing in the input boxes, the corresponding elements will update.

Try not to look at past angular projects while setting things up. 

Try to do it from scratch without help.

Use the Bootstrap CSS library. Use Bootstrap's well class to separate 

your controls to make the page look nice.

The app should be responsive and look nice on small screens.
