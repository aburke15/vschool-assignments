======================

If statements and Boolean logic are used in every useful program to help 

decide what should be done given a certain set of inputs or conditions. This 

exercise will help you become more familiar with these programming constructs.

Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers as inputs. Print out the 

lower number of the two.

Write a function to solve the following problem:

We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters asmile and bsmile indicate if
