Exercise requirements: 
======================

For each step of the exercise, alternate between the two different types of 

function declarations when you are defining your functions.

Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters, and returns the sum.

Write a function that accepts three numbers as parameters, and returns 

the largest of those numbers.

Write a function that accepts one number as a parameter, and returns 

‘even’ or ‘odd’ depending on the Parity.

Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. If the string is 

less than or equal to twenty characters long, return the string concatenated with 

itself (string + string). If the string is more than twenty characters long, return the first half of the string.

Optional Challenge
Write a function that accepts a number ‘n’ as a parameter. Then print the first ‘n’ 

Fibonacci numbers and return their sum.

Write a function to solve the quadratic equation. (It should accept three 

numbers as parameters, and then return an array with the resulting x values.)

Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. Return the most frequently 

occuring letter in that string.
