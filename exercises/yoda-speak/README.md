Exercise requirements
=====================

This is an $http exercise.

You have been commissioned as Yoda's official translator, 

and to make your job easier you want to create a site that translates normal speech into Yoda Speak. 

Luckily, a Yoda Speak API already exists so all you have to do is connect with the API using Angular.

The app is very simple. There is a text box in which the user inputs a sentence. 

When they press the translate button, 

a request is sent to the API to get the translated text. The translated text is then show to the user.
